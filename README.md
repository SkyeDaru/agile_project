This article discusses an up and coming organization founded by Disney VP of Technology Nikki Katz
who has crafted the Rosie Program that give women an opportunity to switch careers in a technical
role. I find it interesting that the objective of this program CODE: Rosie is aimed to expose women
in non-technical roles to the field of software engineering. It is absolutely amazing that after
a three month training period, these select groupof women will go on to pursue a year long apprenticeship
at the company with the chance to take a job in one of Disney's technical groups. The mission of this
program revolves around a frequent conversation involving women who are passionate about tech but feel
that they have never received the opportunity to actually pursue it professionally.

I agree with the objective of bringing more women into technology, as there is a huge gender gap in this field. Pushing women to take this step can break barriers in gender equality in tech spaces.
